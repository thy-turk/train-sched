# Train-Sheduler

## About 
This web page allows users to add trains to the scheduler that will show information about the train. It shows when its next arrival is, as well as how many minutes away it is.

## How to use:
To add a train simply input the trains information and click the submit button at the bottom of the form. When doing so the table above will update and add your train to the list. It will show the train name, its destination, its frequency, the next arrival time and will display how many minutes away it is.
